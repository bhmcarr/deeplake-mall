# Deep Lake Mall
### This sure is a video game.
This repo houses the codebase for the point and click adventure game being made for the Sleepy Chateau Winter 2020 Game Jam!

There a several things wrong with how this repo was set up, and it's moreso here for reference/preservation (please direct all inquiries to /dev/null). It should build in AGS and run on Windows/Linux Systems. Or, you can just go to https://xelti.itch.io/deep-lake-mall to download the release.

We made this in about a month. There are several known bugs (and probably a hundred unknown ones). Maybe one day they will be fixed, but probably not.

Overall, we're really proud that this was our first shot at an adventure game.
